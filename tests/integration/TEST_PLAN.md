# LiqPro Signal System Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the approach for validating the integration between the data collection, signal generation, and scoring services of the LiqPro platform on Solana mainnet. The tests will verify that the signal system can collect real-time data, generate meaningful signals, and provide actionable recommendations based on current market conditions in Meteora DLMM liquidity pools.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify the data service can successfully collect and process data from real Meteora pools on Solana mainnet
2. Validate that the signal service can analyze collected data and generate meaningful strategy recommendations
3. Confirm that the scoring service can evaluate pool health, assess risks, and provide actionable recommendations
4. Test the end-to-end flow from data collection to recommendation generation
5. Measure performance metrics and identify potential bottlenecks

## Test Environment

### Services Under Test

- **Data Service**: Responsible for collecting pool data, market prices, and monitoring events
- **Signal Service**: Generates market analysis and strategy recommendations
- **Scoring Service**: Evaluates pool health, assesses risks, and provides action recommendations

### External Dependencies

- **Solana RPC Node**: Provides access to Solana mainnet data
- **Meteora DLMM Pools**: Target pools for analysis and recommendations
- **Market Data Sources**: Price feeds and other external data

## Test Approach

### 1. Service-Level Tests

Each service will be tested individually to verify its core functionality:

#### Data Service Tests

- Test pool data collection from Meteora pools
- Verify market price data collection
- Test specific pool detail monitoring

#### Signal Service Tests

- Test strategy generation for specific pools
- Verify market analysis functionality
- Test backtesting capabilities

#### Scoring Service Tests

- Test health scoring for pools
- Verify risk assessment functionality
- Test recommendation generation

### 2. Integration Flow Tests

The full end-to-end flow will be tested to verify:

- Data flows correctly between services
- Each service processes the data correctly
- The final recommendations are valid and actionable

### 3. Continuous Testing

The tests will run continuously for a specified duration to:

- Detect any intermittent issues
- Verify stability over time
- Capture performance metrics for analysis

## Test Metrics

The following metrics will be collected during testing:

- **Response Time**: Time taken by each service to respond to requests
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful API calls
- **Data Freshness**: Age of the data being processed
- **Recommendation Quality**: Consistency and validity of recommendations
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and network usage by each service

## Security Considerations

- Tests use read-only operations and do not execute any transactions
- No private keys or sensitive data are used
- RPC rate limits are respected

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Access to Solana mainnet RPC
- Sufficient system resources

### Execution Steps

1. Configure test parameters in the configuration file
2. Start the test environment using Docker Compose
3. Execute the test suite
4. Collect and analyze the results

### Reporting

Test results will be:

1. Logged to the console in real-time
2. Saved to detailed log files for analysis
3. Summarized in a final test report

## Contingency Plan

If test failures occur:

1. Identify the failing component or integration point
2. Check logs for error messages and stack traces
3. Verify external dependencies are available and responding
4. Restart the specific failing service if needed
5. If persistent issues occur, escalate to the development team

## Test Deliverables

- Test logs with timestamps
- Performance metrics
- Summary report with pass/fail status
- Identified issues and recommendations

## Approval

This test plan must be reviewed and approved by:

- Engineering Lead
- Product Manager
- QA Lead
